# WebServicesCourse
My first tries in using kotlin + gradle to learn webservices

## KotlinJaxbExample
This project was the first experiment on JAXB with koltin and gradle.
First you execute the gradle task "xjc" (i.e. gradle xjc) to generate java classes from xml schemas and bindings, the you run the entry point for the application written in koltin testing JAXB runtime by unmarshalling and marshalling objects (i.e. gradle run).
